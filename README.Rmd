The goal of roam is to ...

1. Allow 'regular looking' R objects in packages to exceed the 5MB limit.
2. Support updating of datasets without updating packages by using functions that pull from remote resources.
3. Make it easy for packages to include these 'roaming' datasets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of roam like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mitchelloharawild/roam")
```

## Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(roam)
bee <- new_roam(
  "roam", "bee",
  function() {
    read.csv(
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchelloharawild/roam/main/demo/bee_colonies.csv"
    )
  }
)

roam_activate(bee)

head(bee)
#> The roam data object "bee" in package roam does not exist locally
#> Would you like to download and cache it? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

*The data is downloaded to a local cache using {rappdirs}, then returned as the data itself*

```{r}
#| include: false
#| echo: false
library(roam)
bee <- new_roam(
  "roam", "bee",
  function() {
    read.csv(
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchelloharawild/roam/master/demo/bee_colonies.csv"
    )
  }
)

roam_activate(bee)
roam_update(bee)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
head(roam_update(bee))
```

### Accessing cached data

```{r}
head(bee)
```

### Updating cached data

```{r}
head(roam_update(bee))
```

### Deleting cached data

```{r}
roam_delete(bee)
```

You can even use other package's data.

```{r}
library(fitzRoy)

aflm_season_2020 <- new_roam(
  "fitZroy", "aflm_season_2020",
  function() {
    fetch_fixture(season = 2020, comp = "AFLM")
  }
)

roam_activate(aflm_season_2020)

aflm_season_2020
```
